# Blending-In
A 3D Unity Game Developed for CS452 Computer Graphics Project

## Game Objectives
Each player will have 30 points initially. From among the characters present, the player needs to find the
second player. A player will win automatically when he kills the second player. However, if he kills an NPC,
then he will get a 10-point deduction. If the player’s points fall to zero, he or she will lose and the second
player will automatically win.

## Controls
• Player one moves with W, A, S, D or Up, Down, Left, Right keys and attacks with the F key.

• Player two moves with I, J, K, L keys and attacks with the Ykey

## Bugs/Improvements
Players and NPC have death animation which is too fast for plane to detect and hence pass-through plane and
fall.
